# Project Governance

The basic principle is that decisions are based on consensus. 
If this decision-making process takes too long or a decision is required, 
the Technical Steering committee has the authority to make a decision.

## Technical Steering Committee

The Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is responsible for:

1. General ambitions, objectives and goals of this project
1. Guidelines and procedures and tool selection
1. Architectural and (development) infrastructure choices
1. Raise subjects/issues that are important for the direction/development of this project

The TSC consists of the following members:

1. Sasan Jacob Rasti [@sasanjac](@sasanjac)
1. Sebastian Krahmer [@SebastianDD](@SebastianDD)

## Maintainers

Maintainers are responsible for maintaining parts of the code-base. Maintainers have the following responsibilities

1. Coordinate development activity
1. Make sure code/documentation reviews are being done
1. Coordinate pull-requests
1. Coordinate bug follow-ups
1. Coordinate questions
1. In case of long discussions or arguments, maintainers or other can request a community council decision.

The current maintainers of this project are:

1. Sasan Jacob Rasti
1. Sebastian Krahmer

Any community member or Contributor can ask a question or raise an issue to the maintainers by logging a GitHub issue.

## Contributors

Contributors include anyone in the technical community that contributes code, documentation, or other technical artifacts to the project.

Anyone can become a contributor. 
There is no expectation of commitment to the project, no specific skill requirements and no selection process. 
To become a contributor, a community member simply has to perform one or more actions that are beneficial to the project.

### Notable Non-Code Contributors

The code contributors (who pushed commits into the repository) are automatically maintained by GitHub.
However, many people have been contributing to this project in other forms without commiting any code, e.g., developing new mathematical algorithms.
To honor their contribution, we mention their names as non-code contributors as below:

* Maximillian Schmidt [@masc622](@masc622): algorithm design
* Laura Fiedler [@FiedLa](@FiedLa): algorithm design
* Johanna Pietzonka [@PietzoJo](@PietzoJo): algorithm design

### Historical Contributors

Our gratitude goes to the following contributors who have worked (and maybe still be working) 
in this project before it became open source:

* Tobias Hess
