# IEEH TU Dresden Software

The [`Institute of Electrical Power Systems and High Voltage Engineering - TU Dresden`](https://tu-dresden.de/ing/elektrotechnik/ieeh?set_language=en) is one of the leading German higher education research institutes in the field of power systems.

In the following, one finds an overview of (open source) software libraries with respect to power systems developed by researcher of the institute.


[Power System Data Model](https://github.com/ieeh-tu-dresden/power-system-data-model) is intended to describe electrical power systems. It provides a hierarchical structure/schema to describe unique entity relations as well as parameter sets.
It is available at [PyPI repository](https://pypi.org/project/ieeh-power-system-data-model/).

[PowerFactory Tools](https://github.com/ieeh-tu-dresden/powerfactory-tools) is intended to use for an external usage ('engine mode') of the power flow calculation program [DIgSILENT PowerFactory](https://www.digsilent.de/de/powerfactory.html). Therefore, the Python-PowerFactory-API, provided by the company, is utilized. It is available at [PyPI repository](https://pypi.org/project/ieeh-powerfactory-tools/).

Please have a look at the `example` sections in the repositories.
